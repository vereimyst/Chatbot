# basic chatbot with set games/anime/manga topics

can clarify on set topics that overlap between categories, cannot take more than 1 keyword at once besides if you include a greeting keyword

was planning on scanning in from a txt file instead of hard coding all the key words into a map key values... also a read up a little more on inheritance overriding functions after making this, so if I get back to it hopefully it'll work smoother/have more capabilities
